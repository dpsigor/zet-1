# No Tags Needed on Zettelkasten Git Repositories

Zettelkasten content is very fluid by design. Adding any tagging
overhead would inhibit the cognitive flow more than is practical. Tags
make sense, however, on the publications (books, web sites, articles)
that come from the content contained in any ZK repo.
