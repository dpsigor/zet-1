# Use Markdown Reference Links for Readability

I've flip-flopped pretty heavily over the years regarding the use of [reference
links] in Markdown. But I'm solidly of the opinion *today* that they are
definitely worth the extra parsing they force on any Markdown parser.

This is because they make the actual text of the Markdown so much more
readable, which makes your content more available to people even if not
rendered as HTML.

It also makes it trivial to use the exact same Markdown on paper with a
pen that you would actually type in. This is a core requirement for [my
take] on the Zettelkasten Method.
