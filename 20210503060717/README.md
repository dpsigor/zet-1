# Naming Conventions

I struggle with a consistent way to name stuff. But when something
becomes a publication I think I want to keep to the following
conventions:

1. Imperative Verbs for Tasks, Skills, Like a Job Posting
1. Nouns for Concepts and Terms (Verb Would Be *Grok*)
1. Sentences for Principles, Articles, Rants
